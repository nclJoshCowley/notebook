# Introduction

## Motivation

Both statistics and machine learning (ML) are closely related and yet have 
    distinct differences. 
In these notes, we consider ML to be a set of methods, often involving 
    algorithmic black-box techniques that are primarily focused on the task of
    prediction. Whereas statistics is broader and can focus on other concepts
    such as parameter estimation and explanatory modelling.
